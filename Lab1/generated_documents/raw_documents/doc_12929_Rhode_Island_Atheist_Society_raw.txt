Rhode Island Atheist Society Welcome to Rhode Island Atheist Society.  We are a growing group of atheists, agnostics, humanists, and freethinkers who believe in promoting a positive view of godlessness while building a strong community that we can call our own. We support the separation of church and state and work hard to ensure the wall between them stays strong. Religious groups have a tremendous amount of power and influence in politics and government.  We are the advocate for the non-believers of this state.


Rhode Island Atheist Society is a 501c3 Non Profit Organization

We have also formed an official organization the "Rhode Island Atheist Society". http://riatheist.com/  and podcast http://www.freethoughtri.com

Whether you want to be a strong activist or simply come and chat, please join our group.
