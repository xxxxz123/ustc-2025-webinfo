We are a growing group of atheists, agnostics, humanists, and freethinkers who believe in promoting a positive view of godlessness while building a strong community that we can call our own. We support the separation of church and state and work hard to ensure the wall between them stays strong. Religious groups have a tremendous amount of power and influence in politics and government.  We are the advocate for the non-believers of this state.


Rhode Island Atheist Society is a 501c3 Non Profit Organization

We have also formed an official organization the "Rhode Island Atheist Society". http://riatheist.com/  and podcast http://www.freethoughtri.com

Whether you want to be a strong activist or simply come and chat, please join our group.</description><rating>4.66</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1051815062000</created><lat>41.8300018311</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>596</id><urlkey>atheists</urlkey><name>Atheists</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>871</id><urlkey>skeptics</urlkey><name>Skeptics</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2479</id><urlkey>churchandstate</urlkey><name>Separation of Church and State</name></topics_item></topics><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society</name><id>12929</id><members>350</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3370189</member_id><name>Dan DaRocha</name></organizer><urlname>Atheist</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/6/0/600_13237216.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/6/0/highres_13237216.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>13237216</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/6/0/thumb_13237216.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Providence</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist/</link><lon>-71.4100036621</lon></item>
